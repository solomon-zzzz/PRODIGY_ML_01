House Price Prediction Using Multilinear Regression:

##[Project successfully executed during the course of an internship##

Introduction:

This project aims to predict house prices using a multilinear regression model. The dataset includes various features that influence house prices, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, and more. Multilinear regression is used to model the relationship between the house prices and these independent variables.


House price prediction is a common problem in real estate where one needs to estimate the price of a house based on several features. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict the house price based on multiple factors using multilinear regression.
